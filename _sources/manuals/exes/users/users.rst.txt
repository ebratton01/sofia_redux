Introduction
============

The SI Pipeline Users Manual (OP10) is intended for use by both SOFIA
Science Center staff during routine data processing and analysis, and
also as a reference for General Investigators (GIs) and archive users to
understand how the data in which they are interested was processed. This
manual is intended to provide all the needed information to execute the
SI Level 2 Pipeline, flux calibrate the results, and assess the data
quality of the resulting products. It will also provide a description of
the algorithms used by the pipeline and both the final and intermediate
data products.

A description of the current pipeline capabilities, testing results,
known issues, and installation procedures are documented in the SI
Pipeline Software Version Description Document (SVDD, SW06, DOCREF). The
overall Verification and Validation (V&V) approach can be found in the
Data Processing System V&V Plan (SV01-2232). Both documents can be
obtained from the SOFIA document library in Windchill.

This manual applies to EXES Redux version 3.0.0.
