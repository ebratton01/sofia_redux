<h1>Getting started<a class="headerlink" href="#getting-started" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>This step-by-step guide is intended to assist in manually reducing EXES
data. A more general introduction to the Redux GUI and reduction algorithms
can be found in the EXES Redux User’s Manual.</p>
</section>
<section id="cross-dispersed-data">
<h1>Cross-dispersed data<a class="headerlink" href="#cross-dispersed-data" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Overall process: get the order spacing right, get the slit rotation
right, get the extraction right, get the central wavelength right, get
the dispersion right.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Load in the data (File -&gt; Open New Reduction).</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If there is more than one science file, you may want to select
just one to start with, along with the flat, until you are sure
you have the correct distortion parameters (step 2-3).</p></li>
<li><p>If RAW files are available, load those instead of the truly raw
files. If not, you may want to generate them for all science
files first (by running Load Data), then start again with the RAW
files.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Step to: Make Flat.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Verify that the step completed successfully (no ERROR messages in
the terminal).</p></li>
<li><p>Verify the spacing between orders.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Measure the actual spacing in the image (use <em>d</em> in ximgtool
and right-click to draw a horizontal line), and verify that it
roughly matches the predicted spacing (printed to the
terminal).</p></li>
<li><p>Verify that the calculated spacing matches the predicted order
spacing.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Verify that the orders look roughly rectilinear.</p></li>
<li><p>If any of these checks fail: Undo the Make Flat step (or Reset).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the predicted spacing seems off, it can be fixed by
changing XDFL. Edit Param for the Load Data step to enter a
new value. The value used in the first run should have been
printed to the terminal. <strong>Increasing XDFL will increase the
predicted spacing.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The predicted spacing does not have to match the actual
spacing exactly. It just needs to be close enough for the
optimization algorithm to find the right value.</p></li>
<li><p>Typical values for XDFL are about 85-110. If you find you
have to use values far outside that range, something else
is probably wrong.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>If the calculated spacing or the rotation of the orders seems
off, it is likely that the edge detection routine failed. Edit
Param for the Make Flat step, select Debug, and run again.
Debugging will stop the reduction with an error message and
display some useful images. Buffer 1 is the undistorted flat,
Buffer 2 is the edge-enhanced image, Buffer 3 is the FFT of
that image, Buffer 4 is the region of the FFT near where a
peak is predicted (in the first and second harmonics of the
FFT), and Buffer 5 is the calculated illumination mask. If the
edge detection is working correctly, there will be a clear
peak in at least one of the stamps in Buffer 4, and the
illumination mask in Buffer 5 will match the undistorted flat.
If this is not the case, try a different Edge enhancement
method in the Make Flat parameters and run again. Which method
works best sometimes depends on the illumination
characteristics of the particular flat being reduced.</p></li>
<li><p>If you can’t get the edge detection algorithm to work at all,
it may be that the flat just doesn’t have obvious enough
edges. You may be able to get close to a good correction by
deselecting Optimize rotation angle, and editing the Starting
rotation angle and/or Predicted spacing by hand.</p></li>
<li><p>If the order spacing and rotation look okay, but the pipeline
reports that it couldn’t find the order edges, try increasing
the Threshold factor to make the inter-order spacing a little
wider.</p></li>
<li><p>When you have a reasonable undistorted flat, turn off Debug
and run the step once more.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Step to: Undistort.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Check that the distortion correction looks okay, and there are no
bad nod pairs. Use Display -&gt; Quick Look to step through each input
file. Use Buffer -&gt; Cycle Frames to step through each nod pair in
the file.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If emission or absorption features appear tilted across the
orders, you may need to modify the slit rotation. Reset the
reduction and Edit Param for Load Data to change the slit
rotation. <strong>Increasing the slit rotation angle rotates the
lines clockwise.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>To get the slit rotation exactly right, it may be helpful
to extract sky spectra at the top and bottom of the order
and compare features in the extracted apertures. To do
this, Edit Param for Subtract Nods to skip nod subtraction,
and for Find Objects and Set Apertures to set manual
apertures, then Step to: Extract Spectra. Reset, edit Slit
Rotation, and re-reduce as necessary.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>If there are bad nod pairs (eg. if the observation was
aborted), note the file number and frame number. Edit Param
for Coadd Pairs and enter any frames that need to be excluded
in Exclude Pairs. Files are separated by semi-colons, frames
are separated by commas. For example, to exclude the first
frame from the first file, and the last frame from last file
in a 3-file, 6-nod sequence, enter 1;;6.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Step to: Make Profiles. Step to: Set Apertures.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Check that the apertures have been correctly set.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Use Display -&gt; Quick Look to check each image; look for light
blue lines over the center of each aperture in the image. Look
for a green overlay over most of the source in the spatial
profile. If the apertures are badly placed, Undo.</p></li>
<li><p>If the objects look misidentified, set them by hand by using
Fix or Guess parameters in Find Objects.</p></li>
<li><p>If the apertures look wrong, set them by hand using the
Override parameters in Set Apertures.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Step to: Extract Spectra. Verify the spectra from all
apertures/files look about the same. If not, some non-standard
extraction parameters may need to be used (eg. turn off bad pixel
correction, use median spatial profile, set background regions,
etc.).</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A single file is usually loaded into xvspec. More can be added in
for direct comparison using Add Spectra. They can also be
viewed/combined in the separate tool called xcombspec.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Step to: Merge Orders. Click Cancel in the Refine Wavecal GUI.
Compare the atmospheric transmission in the Transmission pane in
xvspec to the merged spectrum to identify an atmospheric feature. It
can be overplotted on the data with Plot -&gt; Overplot -&gt; Transmission.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The wavenumber of the feature can be measured by selecting
Transmission, clicking on the plot, typing <em>f</em> over the new
window, and clicking on the left, then the right, side of the
feature. The centroid of the feature will be reported in the bar
at the top of the window.</p></li>
<li><p>Measure the wavenumber of the corresponding feature in the
science spectrum by clicking Flux and repeating the above process
to centroid the line. The initial central wavenumber is sometimes
very far off, which can make identification of a corresponding
feature difficult.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Undo. Step to: Refine Wavecal. Identify the feature in the spectrum
(click on the order, centroid the line, click Add from Plot in the
little GUI window), then edit the wavelength to the measured
wavelength from the Transmission spectrum. Click Done.</p></li>
<li><p>Click Reset. The calculated wavenumber will now be used to update
the distortion/dispersion parameters. Step to: Refine Wavecal to
redo the full reduction.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Verify that the distortion correction still looks right.</p></li>
<li><p>Verify that the identified feature now has the correct
wavenumber. If the central wavelength was far off, you may have
to Refine it, and repeat the reduction again.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>If there are overlapping orders, the dispersion may need to be tuned
to get the lines to appear at the same wavelength in each order.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The separate tool xmergeorders can be used to check the
overlapping regions.</p></li>
<li><p>For cross-dispersed spectra, the dispersion is tuned with the
HRFL parameter. <strong>Reducing HRFL decreases the wavenumber of the
left end of the spectrum</strong> (eg. if a feature at the left end of
Order 2 is to the right of a feature at the right end of Order 1,
decreasing HRFL slightly may fix it). To edit HRFL, Reset the
reduction, Edit Param for Load Data, and repeat from step 7.
Changing HRFL will change the wavelength calibration, which
changes the distortion correction, so the wavecal will have to be
Refined, and possibly Refined again.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Typical values for HRFL are about 85-110, as for XDFL.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Step to: Merge Orders.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For spectra with overlap regions, verify that the final spectrum
looks right, eg. that there are not discontinuous jumps, or
excessively noisy overlap regions. If there are, Undo and Edit
Param for Merge Orders. Try higher or lower values for the
Selection threshold. Spectra can also be merged by hand using the
xmergeorders tool.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Finally: save the reduction parameters for the observation, using
Parameters -&gt; Save Current Parameters. These parameters serve as a
record of the manual reduction, and can later be directly loaded
into either the GUI or the automatic pipeline to repeat the same
reduction.</p></li>

<section id="long-slit-data">
<h1>Long-slit data<a class="headerlink" href="#long-slit-data" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Overall process: Same as for cross-dispersed data, except that there is
no order spacing to worry about in the distortion correction, and no
order merging in the final product.</p>

atmospheric feature. It can be overplotted on the data with
Plot -&gt; Overplot -&gt; Transmission.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The wavenumber of the feature can be measured by selecting
Transmission, clicking on the plot, typing <em>f</em> over the new

edit XDFL, Reset the reduction, Edit Param for Load Data, and
repeat from step 6. Changing XDFL will change the wavelength
calibration, which changes the distortion correction, so the
