<section id="background">
<h2>Background<a class="headerlink" href="#background" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>To generate plots in an efficient manner the Eye employs an animation
technique called blitting. Usually when a matplotlib figure is refreshed,
like when a new like is plotted for example, the entire figure is
redrawn. Axis limits are recomputed, all data points are redrawn, labels
generated again, etc. Most of the time, however, few of these objects
actually change, meaning a lot of resources were effectively wasted.
Blitting addresses that by only drawing what changes. It requires the
code to handle the objects created by plotting with matplotlib more directly,
since a lot of the automatic features are turned off.</p>
<p>Updating a plot using blitting consists of two steps. Step one is to refresh
the background. This includes the splines, axis labels, things that do not
change. Nothing is regenerated. A copy of the background is stored in the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Blitter</span></code> class and is merely re-applied. Step two is draw all the animated
artists. These include all data lines, cursor indicators, pane borders, etc.
Basically anything that ever changes. The artist objects behind each artist,
such as the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Line2D</span></code> object behind a plotted line, is not regenerated. If the
line has changed, such as the data points changed due to a units change, then
the data contained in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Line2D</span></code> object is altered. A new <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Line2D</span></code> object
is not created. These “animated” artists are merely redrawn, the bare minimum
that needs to be done to add the artist to the screen.</p>
</section>
<section id="matplotlib-artists">
<span id="id2"></span><h2>Matplotlib Artists<a class="headerlink" href="#matplotlib-artists" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The bulk of the work in implementing blitting comes from handling the artists.
They need to be kept track of, and altered when necessary. Matplotlib does
not make this easy as the different plot types seemingly have divergent APIs.
The main artists contained in the Eye are:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic">
<li><p><strong>Line2D</strong>:
These objects are generated when any data is plotted with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">plot</span></code>
method. They have the most basic API calls. Updating the x-data, for
instance, is done with:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">line</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">set_xdata</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x_data</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>PathCollection</strong>:
A PathCollection is a combination of list of points that describe how to
draw a shape (the “Path”) and a list of places to draw that
shape (the “Collection”). For the Eye, these come up for any kind of
scatte plot, most notably the cursor location (a scatter plot with
only one point). When updating the artist to change the data points, the
“Path” stays the same and the “Collection” is updated. Since the data
underlying a PathCollection is not a series of points that have to be
connected in a particular order but instead a set of x,y coordinates,
there are no methods like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">set_xdata</span></code>. Instead the coordinates, or
“offsets” as matplotlib likes to call them, have to be all changed
at once with:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">data</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">numpy</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">vstack</span><span class="p">((</span><span class="n">x_data</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">y_data</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="n">line</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">set_offsets</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">data</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>PolyCollection</strong>:
A PolyCollection describes areas to be drawn, as opposed to the points
drawn by Line2D and PathCollections. The area is defined bo a set of
vertices that are connected to create a polygon. In the Eye, this
artist is used to define the shaded region above and below a line to
denote the error range and is generated by <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">fill_between</span></code>. Unlike a
PathCollection or a Line2D object, the PolyCollection does not have a
simple method for updating its data. The vertices would be the
property to update, and there are no simple API calls to update the
vertices. As such, when a PollyCollection needs to be updated,
it is simpler to remake the artist.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Patch</strong>:
A Patch is generally a geometric shape used to highlight or block
an area of the figure. Currently the only use for patches in the Eye
are the highlights around the current pane. The highlight ia a
Rectangle patch whose bounds are set to the very edges of the axis.
Since its shape is defined by the axis itself, there is no need to
reshape it. The only alteration that must be done to the highlight is
to turn it on or off, which is achieved through the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">set_visible</span></code>
method:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">patch</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">set_visible</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kc">True</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The artist handling  and how they are draw in the Eye are handled by
three classes discussed below: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Drawing</span></code> , <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Gallery</span></code> ,  and the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BlitManager</span></code> class.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>

<section id="drawing">
<h2>Drawing<a class="headerlink" href="#drawing" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Drawing</span></code> class, found in
<a class="reference internal" href="index.html#module-sofia_redux.visualization.display.drawing" title="sofia_redux.visualization.display.drawing"><code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sofia_redux.visualization.display.drawing</span></code></a>, is the base artist object
in the Eye. Each artist object created by matplotlib gets its own <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Drawing</span></code>
object. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Drawing</span></code> class also keeps track of various parameters that
describe what the artist is, such as the model name, the kind of artist it
is, what axes it belongs to, and what pane it belongs to. This makes it
easier for the Eye to filter the artists, such as finding all artists that
were made with a certain model. Additionally the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Drawing</span></code> class handles
all updates to the artist, and provides shortcuts for accessing various
attributes of the artist such as color and marker.</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Drawing</span></code> objects are only made by panes. When a new <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Drawing</span></code> object is
created it parses its artist object to determine what kind of artist it is.
Available kinds are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>line: Describes an artist created by plotting a dataset</p></li>
<li><p>error: The error range around a data line</p></li>
<li><p>cursor: The marker plotted to denote the cursor’s location</p></li>
<li><p>border: A pane’s border that denotes it is the current pane</p></li>
<li><p>crosshair: A horizontal and vertical line used when performing a box zoom</p></li>
<li><p>guide: A vertical line used when selecting a data range to zoom in on or
perform a fit on</p></li>
<li><p>fit_line: The line of a model fit overplotted on the data</p></li>
<li><p>fit_center: A vertical line at the center of a model fit</p></li>
<li><p>reference: A vertical line at the wavelength of a reference transistion</p></li>
<li><p>text: A label attached to the reference line denoting the atomic or
molecular species responsible for the transition</p></li>
<li><p>patch: Any shapes that might end up being drawn</p></li>
</ul>
<section id="line">
<h3>Line<a class="headerlink" href="#line" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The line drawings holds all artists that describe the data itself. The root
matplotlib artists is a Line2D object. To simulate a scatter plot the Line2D
object applies markers to the data points and makes the line segments
invisible. This keeps the base matplotlib artist class the same regardless
of the plot type selected by the user, as the scatter plot method implemented
in matplotlib generates a PathCollection object, not a Line2D object.</p>
</section>
<section id="error-range">
<h3>Error Range<a class="headerlink" href="#error-range" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The error range drawings holds PolyCollection artists, generated by
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">fill_between</span></code>. When the data in a line or cursor subtype changes, the
corresponding artist not re-created, merely updated with the correct data
points. This is not the case for the error range subtypes. Due to the
complexities of how a PolyCollection artist is defined, it is more efficient
to recreate the PolyCollection artist with the new data and replace the
artist stored in the error range subtype.</p>
</section>
<section id="cursor">
<h3>Cursor<a class="headerlink" href="#cursor" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The cursor drawings only holds PathCollection artists as it shows information
about the data at the cursor. All the artists in this subtype only have a
single data point attached. The data point has the same x-value as the cursor
and the y-value corresponding to the data value at the x-value. The cursor’s
y-value is not considered. Each artist in the line subtype has a
corresponding artist in the cursor subtype. The cursor artists are generated
when the line artist is generated regardless of if the cursor’s location is
to be shown. If the cursor’s location is not to be shown, the cursor artist
is kept invisible and not updated. It is more efficient to keep an invisible
artist in memory than to recreate the artist every time it is needed.</p>
</section>
<section id="border">
<h3>Border<a class="headerlink" href="#border" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The border drawings hold Rectangle objects. Each Pane has one associated
border drawing that describes the border around it. The border is only
visible when the associated pane is currently selected. The only updates to
border drawings are visibility when the current pane changes and color when
the color cycle changes.</p>
</section>
<section id="crosshair">
<h3>Crosshair<a class="headerlink" href="#crosshair" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The crosshair kind is a unique drawing, as there are only exactly two
instances. The crosshair plots a dashed vertical line and a dashed horizontal
line across the span of the current axis, crossing at the cursor’s location.
The underlying matplotlib artists are Line2D objects.</p>
</section>
<section id="guide">
<h3>Guide<a class="headerlink" href="#guide" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The guide drawings are similar to the crosshair drawings except there can be
multiple of them. Guides are used to help denote regions of interest for
actions such as zooming or fitting curves to the data. The guides take the
form of either vertical or horizontal dotted lines, depending of if the task
requires selecting <em>x</em> values or <em>y</em> values respectively. The artist is
created when the user clicks on a location while a selection mode is active.
The location of the mouse is recorded and used to create the guide artist.
Once the range selection ends the guides are removed.
Guide artists are created and destroyed at a higher rate than any other
artist. Their ephemeral status means guide artists do not require updating.</p>
</section>
<section id="fit-line">
<h3>Fit Line<a class="headerlink" href="#fit-line" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The fit line drawings are created when a model, such as a Gaussian, is fit to
a selection of data. The resulting fit is evaluated at all wavelength points
then plotted over the data. The fit lines can be turned on and off through
the fitting results window. If a fit fails then a fit line drawing is not
created.</p>
</section>
<section id="fit-center">
<h3>Fit Center<a class="headerlink" href="#fit-center" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>When a fit line drawing is created an associated fit center drawing is
created. The fit center drawing is a vertical line centered at the peak of
the model feature, ie the mean of the Gaussian. If the model used to fit the
data doesn’t have a feature, such as a linear fit, then the fit center is
placed at the midpoint of the wavelength range.</p>
</section>
<section id="reference">
<h3>Reference<a class="headerlink" href="#reference" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Reference drawings are created when reference data is loaded into the Eye.
Reference data are usually atmospheric absorption lines and are discussed in
more detail in <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/commandref.html#reference" title="(in Python v3.11)"><span>Command Reference</span></a> . The associated artists are vertical, grey,
dashed lines at each reference wavelength. They can be turned on and off in
the Reference Data window. These drawings are unique in that they are not
considered when autoscaling the data. As such all lines that lie outside the
data range are not visible until the <em>x</em>-range is extended. To handle this,
when autoscaling the data all reference lines are initially made invisible.
Then the axis is autoscaled based only on visible artists, after which the
reference lines are made visible again.</p>
</section>
<section id="text">
<h3>Text<a class="headerlink" href="#text" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Text drawings handle all artists that are blocks of text on a plot. They
accompany reference drawings and serve to label what molecular or atomic
species is responsible for a given reference transition. Their visibility can
be controlled independantly of the reference line, however the labels cannot
be made visible with the reference lines invisbile.</p>
<p>Labels are place to the left of their reference line, rotated 90 degrees, at
the bottom of the axes. If two reference lines are close together in
wavelength space the labels could overlap rendering them illegible. To
counter this any time the <em>x</em>-axis limits are changed the text boxes are
scraped and regenerated fresh. Upon creation their initial bounding boxes are
compared and if two boxes overlap (meaning the labels would overlap) then
they are combined. The right most label is deleted and its text appended to
the end of the left most label. This process is repeated until no more
bounding boxes are overlapping.</p>
</section>
<section id="patch">
<h3>Patch<a class="headerlink" href="#patch" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The patch subtype is used for artists describing basic shapes, such as
rectangles or circles, and are independent from any data being plotted. The
most common patch used is the border around the current pane, or the “pane
highlight”. These artists are created when a Pane is assigned an axis and are
not changed. The only change to the patches are whether they are visible
based on if their pane is the current pane.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="gallery">
<span id="id3"></span><h2>Gallery<a class="headerlink" href="#gallery" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The primary purpose of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Gallery</span></code> class (found at
<a class="reference internal" href="index.html#module-sofia_redux.visualization.display.gallery" title="sofia_redux.visualization.display.gallery"><code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sofia_redux.visualization.display.gallery</span></code></a>) is to manage all
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Drawing</span></code> objects created by the Eye. There is only one instance of the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Gallery</span></code> class, kept track of by the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">View</span></code> class. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Gallery</span></code> only has
one attribute, a dictionary that stores the various <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Drawings</span></code> created by
panes. The dictionary keys are the different kinds of drawings:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>line</p></li>
<li><p>line_alt</p></li>
<li><p>cursor</p></li>
<li><p>cursor_alt</p></li>
<li><p>error_range</p></li>
<li><p>crosshair</p></li>
<li><p>guide</p></li>
<li><p>patch</p></li>
<li><p>fit</p></li>
<li><p>text</p></li>
<li><p>ref_line</p></li>
<li><p>ref_label</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Line and cursor drawings are split based on which axis they are on for easy
access. Other drawings like error range are not split based on their axes
because they only exist on the primary axes. The values of the dictionary are
lists. New drawings are appended to the appropriate list.</p>
<p>In addition to keeping track of all drawings, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Gallery</span></code> also handles
drawing updates. Whenever a pane is altered, such as a change in color cycle,
axis scale changed, markers changed, the drawings need to be updated to
reflect the change. Updates are processed by generating a new <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Drawing</span></code>
object with the same identifiers as the target <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Drawing</span></code> but with the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">updates</span></code> attribute populated with a dictionary describing the updates. For
example, to update the color to blue, the updates dictionary would look like</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">updates</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="s1">&#39;color&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;blue&#39;</span><span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The updates are then passed to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Gallery</span></code> which compares the update
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Drawing</span></code> to all <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Drawing</span></code> objects of the same kind looking for a match.
When it finds the match the original <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Drawing</span></code> object is given the updates
dictionary and the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Drawing</span></code> class applies the update to the actual
matplotlib artist. In order for two <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Drawing</span></code> objects to be considered a
match they must have the same:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>kind</p></li>
<li><p>High model (the model’s UUID)</p></li>
<li><p>Mid model (order/aperture number)</p></li>
<li><p>Data ID (used to identify reference lines and labels)</p></li>
<li><p>Pane</p></li>
<li><p>Fields (such as “wavepos”, “spectral_flux”)</p></li>
<li><p>Axes (such as “primary”, “alt”)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Gallery</span></code> class also handles things like clearing drawings (such as
when a datafile is removed from a plot), determining when reference labels
are overlapping and need to be condensed, determining which drawings are
involved in a mouse event, and updating artist visibilities.</p>
</section>
<section id="blitting">
<span id="id4"></span><h2>Blitting<a class="headerlink" href="#blitting" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Blitting is the method used to draw all relevant artists in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Gallery</span></code>
class and is managed by the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BlitManager</span></code> class. Its main task is to draw
the plot backgrounds and artists, rendering them to screen. It keeps track of
a copy of the background of the canvas.</p>
<p>The background is defined as any artist in the plot that does not represent
data. When data are plotted in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Pane</span></code> class, the artists are all
created with their <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">animated</span></code> flag set to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">True</span></code>, which exempts them from
being drawn anytime the standard <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">draw</span></code> function is called. Instead, they
will only be drawn when the specifically called with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">draw_artist</span></code>
function.</p>
<p>If the artists are updated but the background is not, then the background is
restored and the animated artists are drawn upon it. If the background has
changed, then the background is cleared and redrawn before the animated
artists are drawn. By keeping the background unchanged whenever possible, the
processing load of refreshing the plots is greatly reduced, improving
performance.</p>
